# weather-API
This is a weather website that uses OpenWeather API. You can search for any city in the U.S. to get current weather results for that city and a five day outlook for what is ahead. After you search, there will be buttons in the side bar that are clickable, ehich will then bring up the weather data you were looking at for that city. When you leave the page, the last search you did will be stored so when you revisit the page, it will appear again.
